== Assessment Task

Build a new https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-open-service-broker[Spring Cloud Service Broker] for provisioning new
https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo[MongoDB Database] instances with Docker.
The OSB (Open Service Broker) should be designed as an cloud native application.
To achieve this there is a need to be able to schedule tasks to be run on different instances (a possibility would be
https://spring.io/projects/spring-integration[Spring Integration] either with a memory queue or a real queuing engine like kafka or rabbitMQ).
Following to the
https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md[Open Service Broker Spec] it should be possible to
https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md#provisioning[provision] and
https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md#deprovisioning[deprovision] a database
(sample calls are prepared in the appendix, also a spring boot osb catalog configuration).

Focus of this assessment is to give you an opportunity to show your skills, ideas and working philosophy: therefor the how you implement the
code (immutables, null safety, streams, testing and best practices in general) is *more* important then how you implement it.

=== Primary Goals
[square]
* Implement a working Open Service Broker which can
https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md#provisioning[provision] / https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md#deprovisioning[deprovision] a
MongoDB Docker Image
* Implement Unit/Integration Tests (could use https://www.testcontainers.org/[testcontainers])
* Implement a Scheduling Engine (could be https://spring.io/projects/spring-integration[Spring Integration] or anything which works)

=== Stretch Goal
[square]
* Implement OSB reactive (maybe https://projectreactor.io/docs[projectreactor.io])


=== Kick Off Meeting

Please think about what you would have to research to complete this assessment. The research should be kept to a minimum,
so if possible we will either provide the information or adapt the assessment accordingly.
